# Homework-Directory-Creator
This project is a simple bash script that creates a series of directories that I plan to use as the format for my classes as ASU.

## Motivation
I realized that I have a specific directory layout that I like for my classes at ASU. I also wanted an opportunity to practice some bash shell scripting. 

## Plans
I may plan to add or modify the mkdir lines in the future for a better experience.
